# Understanding the Importance of Optimization 

Linear programming is all about allowing us to make the right business decisions. Now decisions are a part of life. Decisions are not only a part of business but part of our professional and personal life as well. Here is an example of a professional decision. Should I do an internship or take classes in the summer? Should I take up the job offer or should I go to graduate school? Should I work in technology or finance? These are some examples of professional decisions that you might have to make but your personal life is also full of decisions. Should I vacation at the seaside or hike in the mountains? Should I go to the party tonight or stay at home and study? Should I have kids now or later? These are some examples of personal decisions that you might have to take. Now on the other hand, companies always have to think about business decisions. Should we as an organization advertise on TV or social media? Should the company invest in a new plant in Texas? Should we update our mobile app to have new functionality?
Well, life is full of decisions and making these decisions is hard because making decisions involves making choices and once you have choices that means you have to consider the trade-offs between the choices. If you make a choice, you give up something. You gain something. This means that every choice has an expected return. This is what you gain if you make a certain choice. Every choice poses a potential risk. This is what you give up when you make that choice. And every choice involves the use of resources that may be scarce. Resources are generally time and money but they could involve other resources as well. What you really need is a framework that helps you make the right decision. How do you make the right decision, given the resources at your disposal and the potential risks and rewards for every choice that you make? This is something that you need to think about and you need to develop a framework for.
When we talk about optimization techniques in mathematics, that's exactly what this helps us with. Optimization techniques allow you to make the right trade-off between risk and reward helping you make the right decision that maximizes what you gain and minimizes what you lose. Let's say, you're choosing between an internship and a summer class. Now time is a scarce resource. You can only do one thing or the other. You need to weigh the real-world experience that you'll get from an internship with the advantages that maybe summer classes will help you complete credits in advance. In making this choice, you have to consider the best use of money as well. Do you have the money to enroll in summer classes or do you have the money to pay for your accommodation while you take-up your internship? Is a internship paying you enough?
Let's consider a choice a business might have to make. Should they update the mobile application or not? Now updating the mobile app may improve the experience for users, but the current app is well tested and robust. People's time is a scarce resource, your engineer's time. This resource might be better spent on bug fixes on the current app to improve their experience rather than a complete update. Money is also a scarce resource. Money might be better spent on marketing your product on better customer support. You have to figure out where you get the best bang for your buck. It's pretty clear that making decisions is a hard process because decisions themselves are complicated. Now, the reason decisions are complicated is because resources are scarce. If you had infinite time or infinite money, you could just choose to do everything. So there is no decision involved there. Now because resources are scarce, you need to use these resources well and optimization is what helps you use your resources well. Optimization helps you make optimal decisions which have the right trade-offs.
Numerical optimization techniques are widely used in business decisions which involve quantitative factors. They allow you to strike a balance. You need to balance competing considerations which involves trade-offs and these trade-offs need to help you achieve the optimal or best solutions. Now the more options you have, the trade-offs become much, much harder, and making decisions become much, much harder. And this is where optimization is so useful. Optimization techniques help you strike the right balance, make the right trade-offs to get to the optimal solution.
