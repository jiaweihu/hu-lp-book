# Linear Programming

Linear programming is an optimization model that can be used when our objective function and constraints can be represented using linear terms. In this course, you will learn how decision making can be represented using mathematical optimization models. You will see how your optimization problem can be formulated using objective functions, decision variables and constraints. Next, using a case study you will understand the linear programming optimization model to find the optimal solution to your problem from amongst the feasible solutions. You will explore the assumptions made by linear programming and also its pros and cons. Finally, you'll see how you can solve linear programming problems graphically as well as by using the simplex method. You will set up your problem formulation in Python using the SciPy library as well as the PuLP library. And you will then use these libraries to find your optimal solution. When you're finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to apply linear programming to solve optimization problems.
