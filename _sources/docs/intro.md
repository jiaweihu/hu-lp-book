# Welcome to hu's linear programming book

Mathematical optimization models allow us to represent our objectives, decision variables, and constraints in mathematical terms, and solving these models gives us the optimal solution to our problems. Linear programming is an optimization model that can be used when our objective function and constraints can be represented using linear terms. Use this course to learn how decision-making can be represented using mathematical optimization models. Begin by examining how optimization problems can be formulated using objective functions, decision variables, and constraints. You'll then recognize how to find an optimal solution to a problem from amongst feasible solutions through a case study. This course will also help you investigate the pros and cons of the assumptions made by linear programming and the steps involved in solving linear programming problems graphically as well as by using the Simplex method. When you are done with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to apply linear programming to solve optimization problems.
