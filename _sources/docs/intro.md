# Welcome to Dan's linear programming book

Linear Programming (LP) is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model that represents problem objectives, decision variables, and constraints in mathematical terms. Solving the models provides the optimal solution. Industries that use linear programming models include transportation, energy, telecommunications, and manufacturing. It has proven useful in modeling diverse types of problems in planning, routing, scheduling, assignment, and design.

This book provides brief descirption to Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP), while focusing on the deminstration of using Python to solve the problems, covering production, manufacturing, capital budgeting. It further provides the Sudoku solver that uses ILP.
