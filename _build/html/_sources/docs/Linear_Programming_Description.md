# Linear Program Description

A linear program deals with minimization or a maximization problem depending on whether the objective function is to be minimized or maximized. The constraints can either be inequalities (≤ or ≥) or equalities. Variables might be unrestricted (i.e. they can take positive or negative values) or be restricted (i.e. can only be nonnegative).\
A general linear program in the decision variables x1, . . . , xn is
therefore of the following form:

Maximize or Minimize $$z = c_0 + c_1x_1 + . . . + c_nx_n$$
