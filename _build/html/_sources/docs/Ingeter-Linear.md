# Integer Programming

As we know, Linear programming is a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. Integer programming is a specific kind of linear programming model, with some or all of the decision variables are restricted to be integers.

## Pure/Mixed/Binary Integer Programming

For integer programming, the decision variables cannot take on fractional values and can only be integers. If all of the decision variables are integers, it is referred to as **pure integer programming**. If only a few of the decision variables are integers, and some of the other decision variables are real numbers, it is referred to as **mixed integer programming**. If all of the decision variables are binary values, 0 or 1, it is **binary integer programming**. 

## Corner point of the feasible region

To the linear programming problem, the optimal solution  will always be a corner point of the feasible region, provided an optimal solution exists.
However, this corner-point property **does not** hold true for integer programming problems, which is what makes integer programming much harder than linear programming to solve.
